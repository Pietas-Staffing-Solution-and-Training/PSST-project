# PSST-project

Pieta’s Staffing Solutions and Training (PSST) is a human resources company in South Africa with the functions of recruitment, staffing, training, and other human resources functions. Jobs are created by clients of PSST and staff who were onboarded previously by PSST are outsourced to complete their specialized tasks in those roles. After staff are placed, their leave, pay, and time worked are recorded. PSST mostly obtains government projects and, as such, does not quote but only invoices their clients.​
